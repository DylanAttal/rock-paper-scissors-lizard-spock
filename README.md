### Summary

I made this project just for fun! After completing the ["Roshambo"](http://roshambo-dylanattal.surge.sh/) project, I remembered a funny scene from The Big Bang Theory where Sheldon [explains the game Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Q6-wMx-K8&t=2s). This app was a good way for me to practice `if...else` statements, responsive design, the `:hover` CSS pseudo-class, and event handling in vanilla Javascript.

### Project Goals

- [x] Create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game with the addition of two more choices: Lizard and Spock
- [x] Make the user play against a computer
- [x] Make the computer choice random
- [x] Use `if...else` statements to create logic to determine the winner of the game
- [x] Utilize `querySelector()` to manipulate DOM elements
- [x] Make a "Reset Game" button

### Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, Javascript
